## Development

View the current version of requirements in [.tool-versions](.tool-versions) (the [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) version management file).

Watch for changes and recompile the typescript with:

```sh
npx tsc --watch
```

### The webpage (hosted via github pages)

The webpage is a static site.

Run the site locally with:

```sh
npm run devserver
```

This uses [lite-server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server) to serve the static files and handles live-reload.
